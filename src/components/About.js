			<h2>What is This Exactly?</h2>
			<p>Merc!<sup>TM</sup> is a web-based board game concieved and created by an out-of-work Web Developer trapped in his house during the fateful Spring of 2020. Originally intended as a PC game about tactical space combat, the project took on a life of it's own and eventually morphed into the card-dealing, credit-collecting, space-exploring "table-top" game it is today.</p>
			<h2>Can I Play?</h2>
			<p>If you want to try it out, you will need to register an account on this site. After that, there's nothing stopping you from clicking that "Play!" link! Just be aware, this project is still in alpha, so it won't be bug-free, and features are subject to change.</p>
